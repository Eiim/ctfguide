🏫 CTFLive Teacher/Host Perspective
    - Create interface that allows them to track student progress.
    - Ability to broadcast messages.

    - Upon starting a CTFLive game - confirm that the socket is being emitted from the host.
        - Why? It is currently possible for the event to be emitted straight from console.
