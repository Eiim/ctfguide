<h3>Contributing</h3>
<p>This website is developed by Laphatize (Pranav Ramesh). However, I do accept code contributions. So please don't be scared to make a pull request. 

For now I'm only allowing changes done to the client side of the website. However, bug fixes and general code improvement PR's are allowed no matter what.
</p>

<h3> Navigating the Codebase </h3>
<p>The /src/ folder is what holds the server code for the API, CTFLive, and the rest of the site. <br>
Client side js, images, css can all be found in the public folder.
The views folder holds static pages and .ejs files.


<h3>Other Information </h3>

Disclaimer: Deploying this website on your machine will not work without a lot of work nor is it supported. Please refrain from doing so.
